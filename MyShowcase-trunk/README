This is a sample Sakai webapp which demonstrates how to make a simple standalone webapp which works with sakai

Build the app by running this command from the location of this README
mvn clean install sakai:deploy
(you need version 2.4 of sakai or better to run this in)

Start Sakai and you will see the new app appear as a tool option
