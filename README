MyShowcaseª is an open source web application which offers personalised evidence gathering for e-portfolios.

Users can gather, map and showcase content from a range of online sources, including social network spaces, to support learning and personal development. MyShowcase offers brand new possibilities for the e-portfolio in the age of social networking and even plugs straight into your VLE or LMS.

* Gather & aggregate - Open up brand new evidence streams for the e-portfolio with RSS feeds, Twitter, Flickr, learner-owned digital files, and weblinks.
* Tag & map - Tag and map evidence easily to competency frameworks, lists of learning objectives, CPD frameworks, and more.
* Showcase - Select, format, contextualise and publish evidence for reviews, assessments, job applications, and ongoing CPD.

MyShowcase was originally developed as part of a University of Hull initiative supported by JISC funding, development was contracted and undertaken as part of this project by MKM Labs.

Originally called CPD-Eng (Personalised systems supporting IPD and CPD within a professional framework), the project has attracted a lot of attention and a number of educational institutions will be piloting the tool with students during the 2010/11 academic year.
